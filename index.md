# Brief Bio for Talks
Karim Eldefrawy, Ph.D., is a principal computer scientist at the Computer Science Laboratory at SRI International. His research interests lie in secure and privacy-preserving computation for distributed and cyber-physical systems, and recently computer-aided formal verification and synthesis of specifications and software for cryptographic primitives and protocols. His research has been funded by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and Boeing and General Motors. He authored over 60 peer-reviewed publications, has over 20 granted patents, and taught several courses on security and cryptography at the University of California at Irvine ([UCI](https://www.ics.uci.edu/)), and at the University of San Francisco ([USF](https://www.usfca.edu/)).
