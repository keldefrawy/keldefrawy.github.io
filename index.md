# Brief Bio
Karim Eldefrawy, Ph.D., is a Principal Computer Scientist at the Computer Science Laboratory ([CSL](http://www.csl.sri.com/)) at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/). His research interests lie in secure and privacy-preserving computation for distributed systems, security in cyber-physical and embedded systems, and computer-aided formal verification of cryptographic algorithms and protocols. His research has been funded by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency ([DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/)), the Department of Homeland Security ([DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology)), and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity ([IARPA](https://www.iarpa.gov/)), and Boeing and General Motors. He authored 50+ peer-reviewed publications, and 25+ granted patents and 15+ pending. Karim served on the technical program committee of several top academic conferences on security and cryptography and was the information director of ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security (formerly ACM TISSEC) from 2011 to 2015. He also taught several courses on security and cryptography at the University of California at Irvine ([UCI](https://www.ics.uci.edu/)) and at the University of San Francisco ([USF](https://www.usfca.edu/)).
