The E2E Argument in End-User Application Design:
50 Years or so Later


Historically, the E2E argument in system design
has been applied to network design and distributed
systems.
While certainly important at the network and
infrastructure level, the last decade has seen a lot
of development at the application layer due to easy
to deployment in business and advances in OS and cloud
infrastructure.
It is very hard to compete these days as a new infra
company with established cloud (AWS, Azure, Google) and
Overlay (Akamai, Cloudflare) providers.

The enterprise is being increasingly software-ized and automated
(see SW is Eating the World by Marc Andreesseen),
and more and more of it is happing at end-points and through
new applications (think Slack, Zoom, MS Teams ... etc).
Maybe with the  exception of Okta and similar companies that
touch the enterprise's IAM infrastructure.

We argue that future security
(confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, and availability)
and privacy and analytics solutions should be designed with
the E2E argument in mind.
Ideally push all these features and functions to the
end-point application and embed them into the
content/data as much as possible.
This has three benefits:

1) Distributes the compute and processing and storage load
2) Provides redundancy, and increased availability
3) Has the potential to still be enforced outside the
enterprise (e.g., for distributed enterprise and Web-3 like
movements therein)


On the face of it, this contradicts the move to the Cloud.
But upon closer and deeper inspection and investigation
these two can be reconciled as follows:

1) Encryption/decryption can happen at end-points and be 
stored centrally unencrypted as a backup

2) Document-centric logs and analytics can be stored 
in the document (and encrypted)
