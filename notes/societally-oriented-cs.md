**On the Emergence of Societally-oriented Computational and Mathematical Research Fields**


This is written from the point of view of someone with extensive practical and theoretical 
experience in the fields of security and cryptography, and also fundamentals of computer science and systems.

Looking at other fields of study, and realizing that the future is composed of human-machine systems co-interacting, I cannot help but see security issues. Starting from undermining the structure of society, or getting to a level of complexity that one (the systems/society ) hits uncomputable problems/issues.
Turing modeled humans and computational devices.
When there interact together, as in crypto and complexity, then we


Crypto emerged as a very important field in response to the creation of the Internet and interconnected systems.
CS and crypto with Turing also existed largely due to the Second World War.
Could we be going through the this now?
The Cold War between US and China will spurr a significant technical jump in CS (and maybe Mathematics).

(1) Automated Cryptography (AC)
To be practically effective (and thus also theoretically)
To be able to respond quickly to adapting evolving challenges
To keep the upper hand on the pace of winning the technological race (and ensure to keep leading)

(2) Computer-aided Study of the Constitution and Laws (CSCL)
What if there are attacks to try to undermine the structure of society upheld by the constitution.

(3) Computational Evolutionary Linguistic (CEL)
How do you study (effectively) the changes in society and try to detects how they evolve and use this as a predictor of societal events and trades.
Once can make concrete predictions here to provide evidence of falsifiablilty aka Popper.
