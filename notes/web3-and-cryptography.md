**Opinion/survey article: the role of cryptography in Web 3.0 (and the future Internet, and Society)**


Started: 05/01

Trying to make things a bit more concrete. I think Web 3.0 will be about three things:
*(1) data ownership, 

*(2) privacy and confidentiality and integrity and authenticity come with it, 

*(3) and distribution.

Distribution will force independence of infrastructure (micorsevices for code).
Programs and data will both start to live in microwaves and both travel to each other.

 Cryptography will be an essential tool but we will need increased automation and high-assurance.
Accelerating hardware will be built for all this infrastructure

We will need overlays and self-organization, healing, and resilience to compromises.
