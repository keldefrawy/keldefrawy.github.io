(had it scribbled a while ago in my Google Notes, Check date)

** Feynman's Cargo Cult Science: **
Seemingly going through the motions and form, but with no subtance and rigour.
True mathemtics and science is like porn, you will know it when you see it.
Hard problems and big jumps are obvious, true accomplishment 

Concept of PKE and tying symmetric and signatures and separating them from PKE.
FHE (based on standard accomplisassumptionshments) is a true accomplishment.
Acceleraitng FHE by 100000 is had and a clear undeniable jump.
Computer-aided verification and automated synthesis.
Factoring efficiently 



** Shannon's Bandwagon: **
ML and Data-driven wave of science and engineering
Big-data
Blockchain
Web3



** What the Greats Missed**
The Internet was not invented and science was a slow moving process and in person meetings made a big difference. 
The noise that Feynman forsaw is now ampilief 1000s of times because of the Internet and the hyperocpetitive nature of academia and research.
This actually
We are talking about opportunistic dishonest beings:
- Quantum MSR paper
- Hypercomputation
- Entire broken schemes




From Notes:

What Feynman and Shannon missed


People need something to do
Universities are too large
Garbage in garbage out
Bandwagon at the institutional level
