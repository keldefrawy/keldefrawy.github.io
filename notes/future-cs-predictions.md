Predictions by 2030:
1- Quantum computing will accelerate innovations in new forms of classical (and especially parallel) algorithms
2- There will be new suprises in CS theorey, i.e., there will be more theoretical breakthoughs than in the past 10 years.
3- There will be several major cybrsecurity events orders of magintue higher in damage
4- ML in its current form will still not be resolved, and will create more problems than it solves 
5- Math litercy of CS graduates will worsen 

We need a restructuring of CS, the term CS should be split into:
- Mathematics of Computing and Systems
- Computer Science

Security is hard, but the failures are also because of the human and education aspects and current incentives, mnore than of fundamental issues.
Given an example of two recent programs:
- DPRIVE (Crypto, HW, Formal Methods)
- RACE (Crypto, Distributed Systems, Networking, Formal Methods?)
- DPRIVE 

CS should be thought from the ground up with a more solid mathematical and logical emphasis and the use of ITP as a way to learn programming. This is how you win the long-term game.
Security and resilience should be an issue on everyone's mind, smae as self-preservation of the human being.

Is my research style/direction shaped by my experience, or is
- Engineering, i.e., build and more applied. Coming form networking, systems, to doing more methamtical protocol and algortihm deisgn, then auomted formal verification.
- HW and SW
